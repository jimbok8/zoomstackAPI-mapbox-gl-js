# OS Zoomstack vector tiles API in Mapbox GL JS
https://tomchadwin.github.io/zoomstackAPI-mapbox-gl-js/

This example is intended to use only the Mapbox GL JS library, with all instances of mapbox: URIs removed. This should ensure that no Mapbox access token is required.

The other aim is to have a local copy of the style JSON, to allow people to edit as they wish.
